Inside each map folder, there is a file named "index.html". If you have file extentions turned off, it may show as simply "index". This file needs to be opened using a browser to view the maps.

Nether-high is a view of the nether with xray turned on and the top layer of bedrock sliced off. You can see the ice roads in this map, but ceiling tunnels block most everything else.
Nether-low is a view of the nether with xray turned on and everything above y=61 sliced off. You can see most of the body of the nether, but not the ice roads.

Overworld-highlights is a view of the overworld with the foliage removed, saturation reduced, and select blocks highlighted. The blocks chosen are blocks that should be very rare in the wild, but very common in builds/bases. Highlights are defined below:
Red -> beacon
Purple -> nether portal
Blue -> ender chest
Brown -> crafting table
