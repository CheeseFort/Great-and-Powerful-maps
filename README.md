# Great and Powerful Server Maps
**Nether-high** is a view of the nether with x-ray turned on and the top layer of bedrock sliced off. You can see the ice roads in this map, but ceiling tunnels block most everything else.
**Nether-low** is a view of the nether with x-ray turned on and everything above y=61 sliced off. You can see most of the body of the nether, but not the ice roads.

**Overworld-highlights** is a view of the overworld with the foliage removed, saturation reduced, and select blocks highlighted. The blocks chosen are blocks that should be very rare in the wild, but very common in builds/bases. Highlights are defined below:
- Red -> beacon
- Purple -> nether portal
- Blue -> ender chest
- Brown -> crafting table
